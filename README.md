Food waste at home is a major problem that continues to occur globally and most people do not realize the substantial waste that one household can produce. At the micro level, we believe that having a tool to keep track of ingredients within a refrigerator and pantry and sending out necessary notifications of when an item is about to go bad can serve as an actionable solution towards solving this problem. 

Preserve is an iOS mobile application that aims to bring this tool to a userâ€™s phone. The user can import ingredients and food from the physical world to the digital world through barcode scanning, receipt scanning, or manual entry. Each item will also be assigned an estimated shelf life based on a dataset from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Users would get notifications on their phone for when an item is about to reach its shelf life. Additional features include recipe recommendations based on the current ingredients.
